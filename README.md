Thanks for the kindness and support , for those who truly cared and appreciated my work and time I invested into these projects over the last 9 months. 
I simply just cannot continue to invest my time and energy thos if this is gonna be the outcome. I didn't get into this line of work to have everything I have done ripped out from under me. I truly hate this worl and the people in it , cant appreciate somebody elses work so they do everything they can to destroy. Well , kudos , ya'll suceeded in making me quit
